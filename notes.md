# Notes.
## Part 2 - API Calls
*   Re-learnt making API calls.
*   We are using **axios** and not **fetch**
*   We do not use a proxy
*   Refreshed my memory on using promises, both using **.then()** and using the more favourable **async/await**. 

## Part 2 - Search Model and Controller
* Using ES6 classes to export models
* Application state and way of implementing state... using Vanilla JS. No frameworks
